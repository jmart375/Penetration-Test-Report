# Penetration-Test-Report

The Penetration Test Report FMJ2 did the following: FMJ2 Net Shield team conducted the penetration test based on the previously developed Penetration Testing Plan. The team employed various testing techniques, such as vulnerability scanning, network analysis, and exploitation attempts, to uncover security weaknesses.  

FMJ2 did this because of this: The aim was to simulate real-world attacks and assess the effectiveness of the organization's defenses. The findings from the penetration test would provide valuable insights into potential points of exploitation and areas for improvement.  

FMJ2 outcome was that: The Penetration Test Report documented the results of the testing, highlighting vulnerabilities that were successfully exploited, potential attack vectors, and recommended remediation steps.  

The next logical step is: To share the Penetration Test Report with Design World's IT team for review and to proceed with addressing the identified vulnerabilities.  

FMJ2 Net Shield team reviewed and updated the initial Penetration Test Report based on feedback and additional analysis. The team ensured that all identified vulnerabilities were accurately described, and the recommended mitigations were well-documented.  

FMJ2 did this because of this: It was important to provide an accurate and comprehensive view of the vulnerabilities to assist Design World's IT team in addressing the security issues effectively.  

FMJ2 outcome was that: The Revised Penetration Test Report incorporated feedback, refined descriptions of vulnerabilities, and provided more detailed insights into potential risks. The report now served as an even more valuable resource for improving security measures.  

The next logical step is: To collaborate with Design World's IT team to implement the recommended mitigations outlined in the Revised Penetration Test Report.
